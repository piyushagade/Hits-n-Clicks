The Objective
-----------

Objective of the game is to guess a 4-digit pin code in as less takes as possible. In multiplayer mode, two people play against each other, and the winner is chosen based on who deduces the code the quickest.

The Concept
-----------

The concept of the game is exactly same as to that of the Cows and Bulls game, which is usually played with a pen and a paper (similar to Hangman, but no poor dude is being hanged here.) The player inputs a guess, and the game responds with two one digit numbers, denoting how many digits in the guess are present in the pin code and how many digits are in the correct position in the guessed number.
